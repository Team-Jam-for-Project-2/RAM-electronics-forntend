As a team we used Trello and met each morning about which steps to prioritize to reach MVP.

First, we focused on making the items and carts APIs on the back end and making interactions with the API on the front end.

We added minimal CSS while scaffolding out the front end components.

When the front and back end were nearing MVP, we started looking for bugs to fix before moving on to polishing up the CSS.

Finally, we split up the CSS by component and added our styles and media queries. 

Jake Steele drew the RAM logo and added that to the final product.

Our stretch goals are to:
    - Modify the way the API works with the item quantity
    - Have authenticated users
    - Be able to make reviews
