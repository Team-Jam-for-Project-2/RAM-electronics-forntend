# RAM Electronics EStore

## Project Description

In this project we challenged ourselves to create an online webstore. It sells electronic products and has various ways to organize the navigate through the products to put them into your cart.

In this repository lies the frontend: components for a homepage, navigation bar, shopping cart, category section, item detail page, and the app as a whole.

As a punctilious person I want to be able to see details about the products so that I can make decisions about their specific qualities.
As an online shopper I want to be able to see the price so that I can make good financial decisions.
As a private person I want to be certain that my information is safe so I don't have to cancel my credit cards, talk to the IRS, et cetera.
As a hesitant individual, I want the data of what is in my cart to be persisted so that I can take time to make my final decisions.

## Future Goals
