As an online browser I want to be able to navigate the items in an organized fashion.
As a punctilious person I want to be able to see details about the products so that I can make decisions about their specific qualities.
As an online shopper I want to be able to see the price so that I can make good financial decisions.
As a private person I want to be certain that my information is safe so I don't have to cancel my credit cards, talk to the IRS, et cetera.
As a hesitant individual, I want the data of what is in my cart to be persisted so that I can take time to make my final decisions.

## Future Goals
